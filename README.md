　　运交华盖欲何求？但是我却“未敢翻身又碰头”。车快到达两路口的时候我内急了，哎！但我的爱是超过我的内分泌的，所以我第一奔向的是汽车站。憋着的尿只是让身体受点损伤，要是错过了丽，我的内心可就伤透了。下车的时候是11：45，不算太晚，但也不算早了。从两路口到菜园坝本需要一个亚洲第二长的扶梯，我没有坐，一来它要花一块钱，二来我觉得它没有我奔跑得快。我基本上是跑下坡的，“亚洲第二扶梯”的高度大家也能够想像一下，我就拼命的跑，有几次因为不太节奏的步调而几乎导致摔倒，但是爱情的动力让我坚持了下去，没有倒。
　　有年来我脑筋里没有灶间的观念。从军前在乡村，起火是母亲的事，与小儿童无干;即使是乡村的大男子，简直也没有下灶间起火的，即使大男子下灶间起火，会让人瞧不起。庄重说起来乡村也没有灶间，一进门即是堂屋，屋里垒着两个电灶，安着两口宏大的气锅，实足不妨把小儿童放进去沐浴。干什么要用如许的大锅?那是由于锅里不只要煮人吃的饭，还要煮猪吃的食，并且乡村人的饭量比拟城里人要大得多，食品又精细，锅小了是不行的。除去这两口大锅，堂屋里还要安一张台子，安不起台子就用砖头垒一个台子，台子的洞里放着碟子碗筷之类，台面上即是安置前辈牌位的场合，耻辱了这场合，就跟耻辱了前辈是一律的。我的街坊家女子和人打斗，简直打然而，就跑到人家的堂屋里，爬上谁人供奉前辈牌位的场合，脱下了裤子。她这一手特殊利害，村子里简直没有不怕的。堂屋的一角，是堆放柴草的场合，咱们管何处叫草旮旯，气象冰冷时，猪就钻到何处安排。在我从军往日，母亲要往锅里贴饽饽时，常常让我帮她点火，烟熏火燎，灰土飞腾，乡村的灶间可不是个好玩的场合。我不愿帮母亲点火，但很愿看母亲整理鱼。吃鱼的时机很少，一年也即是那么三两次。每逢母亲整理鱼，我就蹲在左右看，一面看，一面问，还忍不住伸手，母亲就指责我："腥乎乎的，动什么?"
，主人便说：来啊！我也盼望他们来，于是每天都会往外望，看谁又推过那矮矮的木栅门走进来。有趣的故事又开始了。
Get rid of the school gate, then embark on a journey of himself.
Sick yesterday is very abrupt become so beautiful, inexplicable grew so funny yesterday.
Have who lake, who, everyone still become the past.
The panel of graffiti in my life, is also a kung fu say farewell.
Probably this will become the life traveler, but they make up I mean the whole world.
Also wanted to hurry up and get rid of, get rid of the wall under the xujiaweizi an acre.
Take the shackles of the wall have been found in xujiaweizi neck, feet were tied on the lock, figure was imprisoned in the net.
Every day waiting for others to reward the cold rice, restrain himself to do things in violation of the volunteer.
/ > broken sunshine rainy weather for a week, through the person's mood.
Sunshine like the pieces of broken shell egg yolks, fell into the slops VAT, unable to salvage.
The continuous rain line, all the rope, a bundle of people out of breath.
Finally is sunny today.
Although out of the sun warm, they could not drive net haze of the deposit for too long.
Lie on the bed I see dad.
His face was a.
Eyes deep concave in the eyes, cheeks are fallen through, and convex appear mouth up, stand out.
I think he is awake, he asked him: father, I give you wipe the body good?
He said that not just brush?
I said yes, cool rainy day be afraid of you, several days didn't wipe.
He nodded slightly, said gently rub it for you.
Wipe gently.
Father lying in bed for nearly eight months, the eight months he cannot sideways, can only lie on your back.
Every time a bath very difficult.
I'll lay ready plastic sheeting on his body.
Then a basin of hot water on his bed.
Cast wet towel and gently rub for him.
His upper body almost just one more layer of skin, bones are sharp stick out.
Wipe the body I can clearly feel the hardness of the bones, chrome it hurt my hand, that pain especially obvious, drill straight to the heart.
Dad was very weak.
He can't help but touch like paper.
My hand a little bit, he frowned as he.
Said gently and slowly.
I know he is hurt.
His legs are swollen, two feet always show eight word, points out to the sides.
All swollen like bread.
Left leg swollen is particularly severe.
Under the groin, like purple, large and small, have a heap of bulging tumor.
Is that these hateful thing, and eat out in his father's life.
I slowly gently rubbed.
Remember the last time to give him a bath, he was able to sit up and also insist on a shaking their hands his chest and arms.
Brush less than his two legs, just let me wipe for him.
But now he has not so strong, he can't sit up.
His hand is cannot end to a bowl of porridge.
When you eat, I put the porridge to his lips.
He tried to want oneself to take the small spoon.
Can hand shake a few shake, scoop a spoonful of how to also can't go to the mouth.
Had to sigh, gave up trying to make me to feed him.
I rubbed for him, he has to close your eyes to sleep.
These days, he often so groggy, don't know is a dream is to wake.
But sometimes he opened his eyes from the chaos, said some irrelevant words.
I watched him fall asleep, ears echoed his voice calling me: east winter, to take a bath!
Then there is his strong hand, lift me high, and gently into the birdbath.
That is my childhood memories: there is no such big, no such luxury.
A simple little hut, clean the room tidy up.
The wood yard neatly in the yard.
The middle of the courtyard, there is a big cut to tin bath basin.
The water in the basin has been in the sun all day, the water is so warm.
Bare I sat in this basin, the water overflow from daddy's big hands to me.
Dad and I looked at the water head began sweating completion burging pearl, looking at the sun water into golden shadow, they sway in birdbath, rolled out a happy song.
Dad gave me a bath while taught me to sing
